Sitkalidak is an uninhabitated island just south of Kodiak Island. The Kulluk was being towed from Dutch Harbor to Seattle by the towing vessel Aiviq when it lost engine power, which caused the loss of the Kulluk. Although power was restored to the Aiviq, subsequent attempts at reattaching the tow were not successful, in part due to heavy weather. The Kulluk has on board approximately 144,000 gallons of diesel fuel and 16,000 gallons of lube oils and hydraulic fluid. Currently the Kulluk is sitting upright and there are no observable fuel leaks. The weather continues to remain rough, which is hampering attempts at salvage efforts and site visits.  By Jan. 6 the weather was calmer and salvage crews had stabilized the drilling rig.   As a result the Aiviq, connected by tow, was able to successfully refloat the Kulluk and began towing it to Kliuda Bay, 30 n.m. away.  During the early morning hours of Jan. 7 the Kulluk safely arrived in Kilida Bay and was anchored to its safe harbor assessment position where a thorough evaluation of its condition will be evaluated prior to continuing on to Seattle."

8459,2012-06-06,Fish Market Barge Sinking,"Potomac River, Washington, DC",,,Oil,,diesel fuel,1,,,,,500,0,"BACKGROUND: On Tuesday, 05 JUN, at approx 12:45pm, Coast Guard Sector Baltimore was notified of a barge splitting in half in the fish market area of Southwest DC (Washington Channel) with oil in the water.  At that time, Sector Baltimore filed an NRC report and dispatched a pollution response team.  DC Fire Dept was already o/s and successfully contained the spill with approx 600ft of harbor boom.  The ""barge"" is actually a permanently moored floating structure/storefront used to sell fish.  The rear section of the structure collapsed, sending two fuel storage tanks into the water, each containing approx 150-200 gals of diesel fuel.  Moderate media interest occurred with local DC radio and the Associated Press contacting the Coast Guard for more information.  CG D5 PADET issued a press release Tuesday afternoon.  No wildlife was reported to be affected.  HEPACO was hired by the responsible party (a private citizen) to clean up the spill.  The spill response continued through Tuesday night, though hampered by darkness and a large amount of oiled debris (wood planks, etc.) in the water from the structure collapse.  DC Dept of the Environment was notified and sent inspectors to the scene.  Clean-up efforts continued through the day on Wednesday; however, late morning on Wednesday, HEPACO expressed concerns about the r/p's ability to pay.  At that point, the USCG assumed federal responsibility for the clean-up efforts and accessed the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for $50,000.  HEPACO was hired was issued an ATP of $30,000.June 6, 2012 UPDATE: Spill response continued through the night last night and continues this morning.  Both fuel tanks have been removed along with 95% of the oiled debris and recoverable product.  USCG anticipates reaching an endpoint sometime later today or tomorrow.  USCG Sector Baltimore's Mobile Command Post trailer is on scene and will remain on scene with Sector Baltimore personnel until the response is complete.  There have been no reports of injury to wildlife and no claims of oiled vessels made to the Coast Guard at this time. "

The Coast Guard hired Ballard Diving & Salvage Co. to plug vents and seal the vessel’s fuel tanks.However, a cracked vent allowed fuel to leak from the sunken vessel at an estimated rate of 2 gallons per minute. On May 14, some commercial shellfish operations in Penn Cove voluntarily stopped harvesting on before fuel reached nearby mussel rafts.The volume of diesel spilled from the boat grew through Monday, leaving a very thin coating of oil over the commercial operation, leading the Washington Department of Health to close the area.

The estimated aerial release was approximately 40-50 thousand gallons of diesel fuel and the remaining flow is yet to be determined, but could bring the total to over 100K.  Virtually the entire release is confined to the land, either in the spray area or in a quickly constructed dike area.  Only minor sheens have been reported in the Seekonk River.  Gross oil recovery is nearly complete and gauging is in progress to determine the amount released.  Assessments are in progress o determine the amount of oil remaining in the soil on top of the water table.
